### Description:
This template will allow you to deploy more than one F5 BIG-IP into Azure with 2 or more network interfaces.  Remember that the total number of interfaces that can be deployed is predicated on the number of NIC objects supported by the underlying Virtual Instance Size.  If you choose to deploy on an instance size that only supports 2 NIC's for example but you request that 4 NIC's be cretaed from this template, then template deployment will fail.  Please see this [link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/#size-tables) to determine the Virtual Instances Sizes and the number of NIC's that are supported.

### Parameter Definitions: ###

* vnetResourceGroupName
  * Required
  * The Resource Group Name that contains the Virtual Network that you are connecting the BIG-IP to.
* vnetName
  * Required
  * The Name of the virtual network that you are connecting the BIG-IP to.
* externalSubnetName
  * Required
  * "Name of first subnet - with External Acccess to Internet.
* internalSubnetName
  * Required
  * Name of internal Subnet for UDR, NOT the subnet with the Servers in it.
* f5Name
  * Required
  * The Unique Name of the BIG-IP instance, that will be used for the Public DNS Name of the Public IP.
* f5SKU
  * Required
  * Choose the SKU of F5 BIG-IP you wish to deploy.  Good, Better, Best
* f5Size
  * Required
  * The size of the BIG-IP Instance.
* numberOFBIGIPs
  * Required
  * The total number of BIG-IP's (Up to 4) you want to deploy.
* numberOfAdditionalInterfaces
  * Required
  * By default two interfaces are deployed with this template.  If the VM instance that you have chosen supports more than two NIC objects, you can specify the additional number of NIC's here.  For example if you can have 4, you would specify 2 here.  Zero, means only 2 NIC's will be deployed.
* additionalSubnets
  * Not Required
  * A semi-colon delimited string of subnets, one for each of the additional interfaces. If zero, leave this field blank, if one enter a single subnet, if two type two subnet names separated by a semi-colon with no spaces.  Exmaple subnet3;subnet4.
* adminUsername
  * Required
  * User name to login to the BIG-IP.
* adminPassword
  * Required
  * Password to login to the BIG-IP.



### What get's deployed:

This template will deploy the following inside of either a new resource group or an existing one depending on what you select;

* Premium Storage Container for the BIG-IP's
* Standard Storage Container for boot diagnostics.
* Public IP Address
* NIC objects for the F5 BIG-IP VM.
* F5 BIG-IP Virtual Machine

### During Deployment
During Deployment there are �TWO� references to a resource group.  One is:
 
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tstanley93/Azure-Multi-NIC/master/Azure-Multi-NIC/Azure-Multi-NIC/rg_01.jpg" />

And gives you the opportunity to create new or use an existing.  This is the Resource Group where the BIG-IP's and all of their supporting objects will be placed.

There is also:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tstanley93/Azure-Multi-NIC/master/Azure-Multi-NIC/Azure-Multi-NIC/rg_02.jpg" /> 

This is where you specify the name of the resource group that contains the Virtual Network and Subnets that you want to connect the BIG-IP's to.  The template will use this value to specify the correct URI to find the Virtual Network inside of your subscription.



### How to connect to your Multi-NIC BIG-IP's to manage them:

After the deployment successfuly finishes, you can find the BIG-IP Management UI\SSH URLs by doing the following;  Find the resource group that was deployed, which is the same name as the "f5name".  When you click on this object you will see the deployment status.  Click on the deployment status, and then the deployment.  In the "Outputs" section you will find the URL's and ports that you can use to connect to the F5 BIG-IP.
